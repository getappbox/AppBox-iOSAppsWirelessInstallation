# Upload Chunk Size
Chunk size determines how large IPA files are uploaded in segments. The default chunk size is 100MB, meaning AppBox uploads IPA files in 100MB partitions. You can adjust the chunk size in AppBox Preferences (âŒ˜ + ,).

#### Examples -
150 MB means, If you'll try to upload a 2GB IPA then AppBox will break IPA into 14 part and upload them separately

`2GB = 2048MB`
`2048/150 = 13.65 ~= 14`
Now AppBox will break 2 GB IPA into 14 part and here 13 part will be equally separated into 150MB and last part will be the size of 98MB

`(13 * 150) + 98 = 2048MB = 2GB`


Similarly, if you'll select 100MB chunk size in preferences, AppBox will break 2GB (2048MB) IPA file into 21 part

`2GB = 2048MB`
`2048/100 = 20.48 ~= 21`
here 20 part will be equally separated into 100MB and last part will be the size of 48MB

`(20 * 100) + 48 = 2048 MB = 2GB`
