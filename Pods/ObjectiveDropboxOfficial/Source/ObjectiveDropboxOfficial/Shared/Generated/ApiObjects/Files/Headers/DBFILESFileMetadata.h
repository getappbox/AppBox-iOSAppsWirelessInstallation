///
/// Full constructor for the struct (exposes all instance variables).
///
/// @param name The last component of the path (including extension). This never

/// @param clientModified For files, this is the modification time set by the
/// desktop client when the file was added to Dropbox. Since this time is not

/// @param rev A unique identifier for the current revision of a file. This
/// field is the same rev as elsewhere in the API and can be used to detect
/// changes and avoid conflicts.
/// @param size The file size in bytes.
/// @param pathLower The lowercased full path in the user's Dropbox. This always
/// starts with a slash. This field will be null if the file or folder is not
/// mounted.
/// @param pathDisplay The cased path to be used for display purposes only. In
/// rare instances the casing will not correctly match the user's filesystem,
/// but this behavior will match the path provided in the Core API v1, and at
/// least the last path component will have the correct casing. Changes to only
/// the casing of paths won't be returned by `listFolderContinue`. This field
/// will be null if the file or folder is not mounted.
/// @param parentSharedFolderId Please use `parentSharedFolderId` in
/// `DBFILESFileSharingInfo` or `parentSharedFolderId` in
/// `DBFILESFolderSharingInfo` instead.
/// @param previewUrl The preview URL of the file.
/// @param mediaInfo Additional information if the file is a photo or video.
/// This field will not be set on entries returned by `listFolder`,
/// `listFolderContinue`, or `getThumbnailBatch`, starting December 2, 2019.
/// @param symlinkInfo Set if this file is a symlink.

/// @param isDownloadable If true, file can be downloaded directly; else the
/// file must be exported.
/// @param exportInfo Information about format this file can be exported to.
/// This filed must be set if isDownloadable is set to false.
/// @param propertyGroups Additional information if the file has custom
